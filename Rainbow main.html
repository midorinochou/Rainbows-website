		Ever wanted to have a rainbow for a warbrobe? Well, maybe not an actual rainbow, but wouldn't it be awesome if everything in your wardrobe was color-coded according to the colors of the rainbow? And not just that, if you actually owened clothes in the colors of the rainbow?</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Rainbow World</em> is the place for you!
		<br/>
		This is how we work: you pick your starting color, for example green, then choose your category, let's say skirts, then either choose a particular style in that category, let's say A-line skirts or select <em>"All"</em> and hit the <span>RAINBOWFY ME</span> button. We will then do some magic in the background and present you with all A-line skirts in any shade of green that we have in stock!
	</p>
	<p>Repeat for all colors!</p>
